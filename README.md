# fit52 Prototype
Repo for a quick prototype.

We want to have a quick prototype of the core functionality of the fit52 app based on these screens.
Try to match visual appearance as closely as possible without wasting too much time on tiniest details.

### Requirements:
- Header and footer in first screen must not be functional, just visually similar
- 5 to 10 example workouts in scrollable view as visible in the first screen
- Click on any workout switches to the workout start screen (screen 2)
- Screen 2 will show the cards connected to that workout (random 2-12 cards)
- Click on start on screen 2 will start the workout
- Workout starts with first of the cards as seen on screen 3
- Timer starts from 15 minutes down
- Tap opens full screen video of card
- Swipe will go to next card
- Stop button on bottom right will stop the exercise and go back to screen 1
- Strech goal: Pause button, Congrats screen after workout

### Tools:
Create a branch with your name and use whatever tool you feel makes sense (React Native, Swift, Supernova, FramerX). Get visual elements from slide, internet or Cloris if she has time.
